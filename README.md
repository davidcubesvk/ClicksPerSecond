# üëÜ ClicksPerSecond (CPS)

[ClicksPerSecond](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/57214/) is a fun way to measure player CPS, which competitively
engages and entertains your community to achieve higher scores on the built-in leaderboard system.

# ‚ùì What can this plugin offer you?

Since release 2.6 (a complete rewrite of the plugin), CPS are not counted during manually started "CPS tests", but
constantly during the whole gameplay. The plugin offers you 3 different displays you can use to show the CPS - title,
action bar and boss bar; if that's not enough, with PlaceholderAPI you can show all the information wherever you'd like!

The plugin always keeps track of the highest score and synchronizes it with the file or database - whichever you like.
To competitively encourage players for better scores, or see the "CPS king", you can make use of the built-in
leaderboard system either via the command, or holograms on your lobby, for example.

If you're an admin, you have a full CLI (command line interface) available to manage (view, delete) the data. If you
find someone suspicious, you can also watch CPS of someone with just a simple command, which will switch your displays
to reflect the same what's on the watched player's screen!
